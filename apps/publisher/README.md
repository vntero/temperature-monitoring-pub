# temperature-monitoring-pub
Monitoring of temperate in two cities. The objective is to develop an app capable of getting and processing temperature data for 2 distinct cities. Data must be persisted.

- Version: 1.0

## How do I get set up?
To run the publisher, all you need to do is to run the index file (i.e. ts-node src/index.ts)

### Summary of set up
Since this relies on WeatherAPI's api key, you'll need one of your own.
