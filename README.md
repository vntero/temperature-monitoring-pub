# temperature-monitoring-pub
This project involves monitoring temperatures in two cities with the objective of developing an app capable of retrieving and processing temperature data for distinct cities with the help of a message broker(mosquitto). The data obtained must be persisted.

- Version: 1.0

## How do I get set up?
To set up the application, navigate into each of the apps separately and run the index.ts file (i.e., ts-node index.ts).

### Summary of set up
Once both the publisher and the subscriber are running, you will see logs on both consoles displaying what is being published and consumed.
